    "Else If Statements: Used when you have multiple conditions that need to be checked sequentially.\n",

    "Flow of Execution: Each condition is evaluated in the order written. The first true condition's code runs, and the rest are skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "Structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start with a single if statement.\n",
    "- Follow with as many else if statements as needed.\n",
    "- Optionally end with one else to handle any remaining cases.\n",
    "Key Concept: The order of conditions matters. More specific conditions should come before broader ones to ensure accurate results.\n",
