    "# Mastering Class FRQs on the AP CSA Exam\n",
    "\n",
    "Class FRQs are all about object-oriented programming. These usually show up as FRQ 2, and they test whether I understand how to design and implement classes properly. That means writing constructors, working with instance variables, and adding methods like getters and setters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What these questions ask for\n",
    "\n",
    "- Defining classes from scratch or completing them\n",
    "- Writing constructors\n",
    "- Managing instance variables\n",
    "- Writing `get` and `set` methods\n",
    "- Using `this` appropriately\n",
    "\n",
    "## My strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "I always start by identifying what fields the class needs. Then, I check whether any methods or constructors are already written. If I'm writing the constructor, I make sure to initialize every instance variable, even if it's just to a default value.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few key things I focus on:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Matching constructor parameters to instance variables\n",
    "- Using `this.variable` when there’s a name conflict\n",
    "- Keeping all instance variables `private` and all methods `public` (unless told otherwise)\n",
    "- Making sure every method does exactly what the prompt says—no more, no less\n",
    "\n",
    "Class FRQs can look intimidating at first, but once I get into the habit of building classes step-by-step, they start to feel routine.\n"
