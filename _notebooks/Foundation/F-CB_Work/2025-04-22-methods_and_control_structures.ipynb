    "# Tackling Methods and Control Structures FRQs in AP CSA\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to the AP CSA Free Response Questions, one of the most fundamental types is the \"Methods and Control Structures\" FRQ. These questions usually ask you to write or complete a method that uses things like loops (`for`, `while`) and conditionals (`if`, `else`) to perform a task.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What this type usually involves\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implementing or completing a method\n",
    "- Using conditional logic\n",
    "- Looping through values or collections\n",
    "- Calculating and returning values\n",
    "\n",
    "## How I approach these questions\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing I do is slow down and read the prompt carefully. It’s easy to miss important details about what the method is supposed to return or how it's supposed to behave. I try to sketch out what I want the method to do in plain English before writing any code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few things that help me:\n",
    "\n",
    "- I write small test cases in my head or on paper to see what should happen.\n",
    "- I double-check the method signature (especially the return type).\n",
    "- I watch out for off-by-one errors in loops—it’s a common place to slip up.\n",
    "- If I need to keep track of a running total or count, I make sure to initialize that variable properly outside of the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "These questions are usually straightforward once I break them into small steps.\n"
