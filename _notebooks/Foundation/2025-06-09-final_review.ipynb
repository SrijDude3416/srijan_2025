    "The Digital Bathroom Pass System is a full-stack application designed to improve transparency, accountability, and efficiency in managing student bathroom requests. The system is composed of a custom backend and an interactive frontend, both developed with scalability and usability in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tinkle Backend**\n",
    "The backend, named *Tinkle*, serves as the data engine of the system. It tracks and organizes bathroom usage across multiple classrooms and users. Key features include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A dashboard displaying individual student bathroom usage over time\n",
    "* Bar graphs that highlight frequent users to identify usage trends and outliers\n",
    "* Real-time queue visibility for each teacher, showing which students are currently out or waiting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Frontend Interface**\n",
    "The frontend provides a responsive user interface for both students and teachers. Key functionality includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A live queue display that shows who is currently in line and who has been approved\n",
    "* Teacher-specific controls allowing each teacher to create and manage their own queue independently\n",
    "* Clean, user-friendly design accessible on both desktops and mobile devices\n",
    "\n",
    "This project exemplifies the goals of the HyFlex Learning Model by integrating core technical skills with real-world functionality. Students built a system that supports both administrative insight and classroom efficiency, while applying principles of Agile development, collaborative teamwork, and role-based project ownership.\n",
