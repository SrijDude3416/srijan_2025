    "#### Tinkle Time - Digital Bathroom Pass System\n",
    "Absolutely. Here is a clear and professional **project description focused on the system itself**, integrating the technical details you provided:\n",

    "**Digital Bathroom Pass System (Hall Pass Project)**\n",
    "*Open Coding Society | HyFlex Learning Model*\n",
    "\n",
    "The Digital Bathroom Pass System is a full-stack application designed to improve transparency, accountability, and efficiency in managing student bathroom requests. The system is composed of a custom backend and an interactive frontend, both developed with scalability and usability in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tinkle Backend**\n",
    "The backend, named *Tinkle*, serves as the data engine of the system. It tracks and organizes bathroom usage across multiple classrooms and users. Key features include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A dashboard displaying individual student bathroom usage over time\n",
    "* Bar graphs that highlight frequent users to identify usage trends and outliers\n",
    "* Real-time queue visibility for each teacher, showing which students are currently out or waiting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Frontend Interface**\n",
    "The frontend provides a responsive user interface for both students and teachers. Key functionality includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A live queue display that shows who is currently in line and who has been approved\n",
    "* Teacher-specific controls allowing each teacher to create and manage their own queue independently\n",
    "* Clean, user-friendly design accessible on both desktops and mobile devices\n",
    "\n",
    "This project exemplifies the goals of the HyFlex Learning Model by integrating core technical skills with real-world functionality. Students built a system that supports both administrative insight and classroom efficiency, while applying principles of Agile development, collaborative teamwork, and role-based project ownership.\n",

    "## Unique Qualities\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Adaptable Contributor**: Transitioned across multiple development teams based on project needs, from Agile Toolkit to the Person Database, successfully implementing the Groups feature by quickly integrating into new codebases and workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Versatile Project Roles**: Served as a team member (Person/Groups), Scrum Master (ScreenQueue), and overall Project Lead (P1 Tri 2), gaining end-to-end experience in software development lifecycles and collaborative team dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cross-Feature Debugging Expertise**: ScreenQueue’s reliance on multiple system components has made me highly skilled at identifying and resolving bugs caused by changes in interconnected features, regardless of who committed the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Full-Stack Problem Solver**: Developed confidence debugging not just my own code, but diagnosing, tracing, and fixing issues introduced by others—often under time pressure during live classroom usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Technical Communicator**: Queue has been one of the most complex and widely used features in our system. Explaining its design and functionality has strengthened my ability to communicate technical concepts clearly to both developers and end-users.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **System Thinking and Integration**: By working on high-dependency features, I’ve developed a strong sense of system architecture and the importance of stable integration, version control, and modular design.\n",

    "[N@TM - Night at the Museum](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7336525308935737344/?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7336525308935737344%2C7336645664581349376%29&dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287336645664581349376%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7336525308935737344%29)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Digital Bathroom Pass System was publicly presented at two major school-wide and public expositions: **Night at the Museum** and **CTE Expo**. These events gave our team the opportunity to share the work we had developed over the course of several months with a wide audience, including students, educators, parents, and school leadership.\n",
    "\n",
    "At **Night at the Museum**, we received valuable user-focused feedback that highlighted both the system’s strengths and areas for future refinement. Demonstrating the project live allowed us to observe how intuitive (or unintuitive) certain features were to first-time users. This direct feedback led to improvements in queue visibility and teacher controls, and even sparked ideas for broader classroom use beyond our original scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "At **CTE Expo**, the project was viewed by the **principal of Del Norte High School**, who expressed interest in its potential for school-wide impact. That visibility reinforced the relevance of the work we were doing and helped validate our approach to solving a real operational challenge using full-stack software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, the system is **live and in active use** across **all Computer Science (CS) periods at Del Norte High School**, managing real-time student bathroom queues daily. Teachers create and manage their own queues, while the backend monitors usage patterns. Students check in and out through the interface, and all data is analyzed to improve efficiency and fairness.\n",
    "\n",
    "We hope to expand the system’s deployment to more classrooms next year, adapting its functionality to meet the needs of other departments and workflows. This long-term, real-world usage aligns with the **HyFlex Learning Model** by transforming a class project into a sustainable, student-owned solution that impacts the school community beyond the classroom.\n",
